//You are given an integer array/list(ARR) of size N. It contains only 0s, 1s and 2s. Write a solution to sort this array/list in a 'single scan'.
'Single Scan' refers to iterating over the array/list just once or to put it in other words, you will be visiting each element in the array/list just once.
